 ### `Sports Team IDs:`

 You can find the IDs for the teams you want to add from ESPN's API:
 
 MLB - https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/baseball/mlb/teams
 
 NHL - https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/hockey/nhl/teams
 
 NBA - https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/teams
 
 NFL - https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/teams
 

 I believe there are a few other sports available.
