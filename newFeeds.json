This event is intended for participants aged 10+ years, and the model will be available on a first-come-first-serve basis, at participating locations, while supplies last. </p><p>What's important to note is that the Grogu model is not available for purchase.

This event is intended for participants aged 10+ years, and the model will be available on a first-come-first-serve basis, at participating locations, while supplies last. \nWhat's important to note is that the Grogu model is not available for purchase.

which is truly impressive since he&rsquo;s tested more than 170 TVs with highly specialized equipment. &ldquo;If you can afford it, the stunning LG Evo G5 is simply one of the most gorgeous TVs you can buy,&rdquo; Greenwald explained in his <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/lg-55-inch-evo-g5-oled-tv\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>review</u></a>.</p><p>The LG Evo G5 knocks it out of the park in terms of brightness, with super accurate colors. The &ldquo;G&rdquo; is LG&rsquo;s Gallery series, which comes with a slim design meant to be hung on the wall, sitting nearly flush. The modern edge-to-edge screen comes with hardly any bezel.</p><p>In terms of <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/best-budget-gaming-tvs\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">gaming</a>, the LG Evo G5 has a 144Hz refresh rate that can reach up to 165Hz with variable refresh rate (VRR). Greenwald&rsquo;s testing shows input lag of 4.8 milliseconds, which is well below the 10-millisecond threshold considered to be acceptable for gaming. In simpler terms, that&rsquo;s less than one frame of latency per second.</p><h3>Size options</h3><p>The LG Evo G5 comes in 55, 65, 77, 83, and 97 inches.&nbsp;</p><h3>Another pick worth

model. Mashable&rsquo;s sister publication, CNET (also published by Ziff Davis),&nbsp;considers the LG C4, which debuted in 2024, to be an excellent OLED TV. This model is brighter than its C3 predecessor and comes with a 144Hz refresh rate. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/lg-oled-c4-review-high-end-staple-balances-picture-quality-and-value/\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">CNET&rsquo;s review</a> said, &ldquo;The LG C4 combines superb picture quality with a price that's not incredibly unreasonable, making it a top dog among its competitors.&rdquo;</p><p>The size range here leans smaller, with the option of 42- and 48-inch versions, which are smaller than the LG Evo G5 goes (the smallest G5 is 55 inches). Of course, smaller means a more affordable price, and the 42- and 48-inch LG C4 come in at under $1,000.</p><h3>Size options</h3><p>The LG C4 comes in 42, 48, 55, 65, 77, and 83 inches.</p><h2>Best budget brands: Hisense and TCL</h2><p>You don&rsquo;t need to spend several thousand dollars to get a great TV. Budget-friendly options come with plenty of features packed into a high-quality screen, and many options cost less than $1,000. In terms of brands, Greenwald says Hisense and TCL lead the way as the best options that offer affordable prices without skimping on quality. Here are a few picks Greenwald recommends after extensive testing.</p><h3>Best Hisense</h3><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n    <div

comes with features and a display that feels like it should cost much more. &ldquo;Hisense once again hits it out of the park with a premium TV that rivals much more expensive competitors,&rdquo; mentioned Greenwald in his <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/hisense-65u8n\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>PCMag review</u></a>, while listing it as a &ldquo;fantastic value.&rdquo;</p><p>In Greenwald&rsquo;s testing, the U8N was shockingly impressive, hitting 920 nits in HDR Theater mode and then achieving 2,755 nits when testing with an 18 percent white field. For comparison, the Samsung QN90D (which costs more than double the U8N&rsquo;s price) only gets to 1,253 nits with an 18 percent white field. Greenwald also mentioned that off-angle viewing of the U8N is pretty perfect with no desaturation.</p><h3>Best TCL</h3><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row

spot. Finding the balance between affordable price and great image quality, we consider the TCL QM8 to be an excellent option for most people. Greenwald&rsquo;s testing showed incredible brightness levels thanks to the 4K QLED with HDR content in Dolby Vision. Greenwald also mentioned &ldquo;very good color performance, and loads of useful features,&rdquo; which add to the attractively affordable price. &ldquo;It beats rival Hisense models in peak brightness, so it's the TV to get if you simply want the highest light output.&rdquo;</p><p>Gaming stats are also impressive, with a 120Hz native refresh rate that can reach up to 144Hz with VRR support from AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. Input lag is also impressive, measuring just 6.4 milliseconds in Game Mode, according to Greenwald&rsquo;s testing, which makes it slightly quicker than the Hisense U8N.&nbsp;</p><p>The TCL QM8's size options are also impressive, ranging from 65 to a massive 115 inches.</p><h3>Size options</h3><p>The TCL QM8 comes in 65, 75, 85, 98, and 115 inches.</p><h2>Best brand for unique features: Samsung</h2><p>Samsung earns the top spot as the best TV manufacturer with unique feature offerings. The brand has several impressive models that wow in terms of performance, plus it's one of the only manufacturers to release 8K TVs (but you don&rsquo;t need one). Samsung&rsquo;s The Frame lineup is also noteworthy.&nbsp;</p><h3>Best Samsung for displaying art</h3><div class=\"flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear\">\n

what you want if you like the idea of your TV also serving as a digital picture frame. When you&rsquo;re not watching TV, The Frame can go into Art Mode, giving you access to the library of graphics or giving you the option to display your own photos. Customizing The Frame&rsquo;s functions is also possible, so the TV (including Art Mode) can power off when it detects no one is in the room. Greenwald also mentions that many libraries and museums offer <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-55-inch-class-the-frame-qled-tv\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>free high-resolution images</u></a> of paintings that you can add to The Frame&rsquo;s library to display in your home.</p><p>The overall look of The Frame is meant to be similar to a hanging piece of art, sitting nearly flush with the wall, and the matte finish cuts down on glare while also adding to the overall art aesthetic. Greenwald explained in his review, &ldquo;You can even set the ambient art mode to display a matte frame around the picture to further improve the illusion. With the backlight set to a moderate level, the effect is striking and stealthy enough that guests could mistake what appears on screen for a framed painting at first glance.&rdquo; Thanks to these features, he&rsquo;s ranked it as his top pick for a <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-digital-picture-frames\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>digital picture frame</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Greenwald doesn&rsquo;t feel that The Frame&rsquo;s performance as a TV justifies the price. He noted, &ldquo;For watching videos, the TV's performance is more in line with very good budget models.&rdquo;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9yXVP2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Frame%20Pro&object_type=article&object_uuid=02o4yqLfF5FDO6Bf7XV186Q&short_url=9yXVP2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall\" rel=\"sponsored\"  title=\"(opens in a new window)\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"><u>Frame Pro</u></a> is an updated version of the original offering, and the nearly wireless design is a cool upgrade. It still needs a power cord, but everything else, like HDMI ports, is stored in a Wireless One Connect Box. Samsung also upgraded to a Neo QLED 4K display with <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-65-inch-the-frame-pro\" target=\"_blank\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\">The Frame Pro</a>. But again, Greenwald thinks more affordable options, specifically the Hisense U8N, offer a better value unless you find the Art Mode features worth the cost.</p><h3>Size options</h3><p>Samsung The

              "content:encodedSnippet": "Buying a new TV is intimidating. Look for one online and you’ll get bombarded with acronyms and numbers. Visit a store and you’ll come face-to-face with a wall of images that are more confusing than helpful. But we all know that once it’s in our living rooms, we’ll spend thousands of hours relying on that screen to transport us to The White Lotus, make sure we’re caught up on Oscar-worthy films, show us all the NFL action, and even serve as a hub for learning basically anything via YouTube. \nSince we spend so much time with our TVs, it’s worth doing a bit of research to make sure you’re buying the right TV for your preferences, including budget, made by a trustworthy brand. But instead of opening 57 browser tabs to Google all of the TV jargon, we’ve checked in with home entertainment expert Will Greenwald, a Lead Analyst at PCMag, which Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis, also owns.\n\n        SEE ALSO:\n        \n            The best time to buy a TV: A guide to the times of year that you'll find the best TV deals\n            \n        \n    \nFollowing Greenwald’s expertise (he and the PCMag team use high-end equipment to test each TV) and Mashable’s experience, we’ve narrowed down the best TV brands to a list that’s easy to digest. Below, we’ll explain which TV brands excel where and mention a few top picks from each brand to help narrow down your endless options.\nBest OLED brand: LG\nLG makes some of the best OLED TVs on the market today. They offer superior image contrast and close to perfect black levels, and they tend to be great when viewed from an off-angle. The LG lineup of sizes and prices is also noteworthy, allowing shoppers to spend less than $1,000.\nBest LG OLED TV\n\n    \n                                        \n                                        \n$3,296.99\n                                                     at B&H Photo Video\n                                                \nShop Now\n                        \nWhy we like it\nWithout wasting any time, Greenwald wrote to Mashable, “The LG Evo G5 is the best OLED TV I've seen yet,” which is truly impressive since he’s tested more than 170 TVs with highly specialized equipment. “If you can afford it, the stunning LG Evo G5 is simply one of the most gorgeous TVs you can buy,” Greenwald explained in his review.\nThe LG Evo G5 knocks it out of the park in terms of brightness, with super accurate colors. The “G” is LG’s Gallery series, which comes with a slim design meant to be hung on the wall, sitting nearly flush. The modern edge-to-edge screen comes with hardly any bezel.\nIn terms of gaming, the LG Evo G5 has a 144Hz refresh rate that can reach up to 165Hz with variable refresh rate (VRR). Greenwald’s testing shows input lag of 4.8 milliseconds, which is well below the 10-millisecond threshold considered to be acceptable for gaming. In simpler terms, that’s less than one frame of latency per second.\nSize options\nThe LG Evo G5 comes in 55, 65, 77, 83, and 97 inches. \nAnother pick worth considering\n\n    \n                                        \n                                        \n$1,496.99\n                                                     at Walmart\n                                                \n$2,699\n                                                                             Save $1,202.01\n                                                            \nShop Now\n                        \nWhy we like it\nIf you’re looking for an LG TV that’s less expensive than the Evo G5, the C4 is a standout model. Mashable’s sister publication, CNET (also published by Ziff Davis), considers the LG C4, which debuted in 2024, to be an excellent OLED TV. This model is brighter than its C3 predecessor and comes with a 144Hz refresh rate. CNET’s review said, “The LG C4 combines superb picture quality with a price that's not incredibly unreasonable, making it a top dog among its competitors.”\nThe size range here leans smaller, with the option of 42- and 48-inch versions, which are smaller than the LG Evo G5 goes (the smallest G5 is 55 inches). Of course, smaller means a more affordable price, and the 42- and 48-inch LG C4 come in at under $1,000.\nSize options\nThe LG C4 comes in 42, 48, 55, 65, 77, and 83 inches.\nBest budget brands: Hisense and TCL\nYou don’t need to spend several thousand dollars to get a great TV. Budget-friendly options come with plenty of features packed into a high-quality screen, and many options cost less than $1,000. In terms of brands, Greenwald says Hisense and TCL lead the way as the best options that offer affordable prices without skimping on quality. Here are a few picks Greenwald recommends after extensive testing.\nBest Hisense\n\n    \n                                        \n                                        \n$947.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n$1,499.99\n                                                                             Save $552\n                                                            \nShop Now\n                        \nWhy we like it\nThe 4K QLED Hisense U8N comes with features and a display that feels like it should cost much more. “Hisense once again hits it out of the park with a premium TV that rivals much more expensive competitors,” mentioned Greenwald in his PCMag review, while listing it as a “fantastic value.”\nIn Greenwald’s testing, the U8N was shockingly impressive, hitting 920 nits in HDR Theater mode and then achieving 2,755 nits when testing with an 18 percent white field. For comparison, the Samsung QN90D (which costs more than double the U8N’s price) only gets to 1,253 nits with an 18 percent white field. Greenwald also mentioned that off-angle viewing of the U8N is pretty perfect with no desaturation.\nBest TCL\n\n    \n                                        \n                                        \n$897.96\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \nShop Now\n                        \nWhy we like it\nOn Mashable’s list of the best 65+ inch TVs, the TCL QM8 earns the top spot. Finding the balance between affordable price and great image quality, we consider the TCL QM8 to be an excellent option for most people. Greenwald’s testing showed incredible brightness levels thanks to the 4K QLED with HDR content in Dolby Vision. Greenwald also mentioned “very good color performance, and loads of useful features,” which add to the attractively affordable price. “It beats rival Hisense models in peak brightness, so it's the TV to get if you simply want the highest light output.”\nGaming stats are also impressive, with a 120Hz native refresh rate that can reach up to 144Hz with VRR support from AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. Input lag is also impressive, measuring just 6.4 milliseconds in Game Mode, according to Greenwald’s testing, which makes it slightly quicker than the Hisense U8N. \nThe TCL QM8's size options are also impressive, ranging from 65 to a massive 115 inches.\nSize options\nThe TCL QM8 comes in 65, 75, 85, 98, and 115 inches.\nBest brand for unique features: Samsung\nSamsung earns the top spot as the best TV manufacturer with unique feature offerings. The brand has several impressive models that wow in terms of performance, plus it's one of the only manufacturers to release 8K TVs (but you don’t need one). Samsung’s The Frame lineup is also noteworthy. \nBest Samsung for displaying art\n\n    \n                                        \n                                        \n$1,297.99\n                                                     at Walmart\n                                                \n$2,299\n                                                                             Save $1,001.01\n                                                            \nShop Now\n                        \n                                        \n                                        \n$2,197.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \nShop Now\n                        \nWhy we like it\nWithout a doubt, Samsung’s family of The Frame models is what you want if you like the idea of your TV also serving as a digital picture frame. When you’re not watching TV, The Frame can go into Art Mode, giving you access to the library of graphics or giving you the option to display your own photos. Customizing The Frame’s functions is also possible, so the TV (including Art Mode) can power off when it detects no one is in the room. Greenwald also mentions that many libraries and museums offer free high-resolution images of paintings that you can add to The Frame’s library to display in your home.\nThe overall look of The Frame is meant to be similar to a hanging piece of art, sitting nearly flush with the wall, and the matte finish cuts down on glare while also adding to the overall art aesthetic. Greenwald explained in his review, “You can even set the ambient art mode to display a matte frame around the picture to further improve the illusion. With the backlight set to a moderate level, the effect is striking and stealthy enough that guests could mistake what appears on screen for a framed painting at first glance.” Thanks to these features, he’s ranked it as his top pick for a digital picture frame. \nSadly, Greenwald doesn’t feel that The Frame’s performance as a TV justifies the price. He noted, “For watching videos, the TV's performance is more in line with very good budget models.”\nThe Frame Pro is an updated version of the original offering, and the nearly wireless design is a cool upgrade. It still needs a power cord, but everything else, like HDMI ports, is stored in a Wireless One Connect Box. Samsung also upgraded to a Neo QLED 4K display with The Frame Pro. But again, Greenwald thinks more affordable options, specifically the Hisense U8N, offer a better value unless you find the Art Mode features worth the cost.\nSize options\nSamsung The Frame comes in 43, 50, 55, 65, 75, and 85 inches.\nSamsung The Frame Pro comes in 65, 75, and 85 inches.\nBest Samsung OLED\n\n    \n                                        \n                                        \n$2,297.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \n$2,797.99\n                                                                             Save $500\n                                                            \nShop Now\n                        \nWhy we like it\nThe Samsung S95D is a great option, performing well in terms of contrast, variety of features, and gaming specs. Greenwald said it has “fantastic contrast and color that OLED TVs typically offer, along with light output that rivals many high-end LED models.” The S95D earned a PCMag Editors’ Choice award thanks to its specs, including almost undetectable input lag. But the real appeal of the Samsung S95D is the picture quality with perfect black levels and detailed shadows, as seen by Greenwald’s testing results.\nThe included Eco Remote has solar recharging capabilities, which feels like a modern and thoughtful touch on Samsung’s part. Plus, it comes with Samsung’s One Connect Box, which is always welcomed since it moves all connection ports to an external component, allowing for a slimmer design.\nSize options\nThe Samsung S95D comes in 55, 65, and 77 inches.\nA Samsung OLED to keep an eye on\n\n    \n                                        \n                                        \n$3,297.99\n                                                     at Amazon\n                                                \nShop Now\n                        \nWhy we like it\nThe 4K OLED Samsung S95F impressed Greenwald when he tested a pre-production version, being the brand’s brightest OLED yet, dethroning its predecessor, the Samsung S95D. The built-in speakers on almost all TVs aren’t worth using (you should probably upgrade to a soundbar), but Greenwald was actually impressed with the advanced speaker system on the Samsung S95F.

Smart rings are posed as a discreet option, looking like a regular piece of jewelry. However, to be frank, they don't blend in that well. In my weeks of testing, while wearing the rings during hangouts, someone would inevitably ask me, \"What's that?\"\nSince a smart ring doesn't have a screen, you have to pull out your phone and open an app whenever you want to track activity. That's certainly not the end of the world, but if you convert from a smartwatch, you'll miss the convenience of tapping your wrist. That being said, I actually find a smart ring most useful when paired with a smartwatch. I ran all my testing while simultaneously wearing an Apple Watch, and I appreciated the smart rings that were compatible with my watch so I could receive push notifications.\nWhat's the best smart ring?\nThe smart ring market is ever-growing, with new models debuting each year. Samsung just launched a smart ring in 2024, and while Apple doesn't have a smart ring on the market yet, we're sure it will be here in a matter of time. But smart rings are synonymous with the Oura Ring, a leader in the field. After spending weeks with the device, testing its hype, and comparing it to other devices, we can confidently say it is the best ring.\nIt offers the most expansive biometric tracking, monitoring your health around the clock. It focuses on daily and long-term health goals more holistically than other rings.\nHowever, the Oura Ring has downsides, like a monthly subscription fee. If you're not down for a monthly fee, we tested some other viable smart ring options.",

              "content:encodedSnippet": "Boston Red Sox first baseman Triston Casas sustained a ruptured left patellar tendon in Friday's 6-1 win over the Minnesota Twins, the team announced on Saturday. \nThe Red Sox don't expect Casas to return this season after undergoing surgery to repair the injury, chief baseball officer Craig Breslow told reporters. As a point of comparison, New York Mets closer Edwin Díaz missed the entire 2023 season after tearing his patellar tendon during the World Baseball Classic. \nCasas sustained what manager Alex Cora called a \"significant knee injury\" during the second inning of Friday's game. The 25-year-old was hurt while running out a chopper down the first base line. He sped up as Twins pitcher Joe Ryan bobbled the ball and was called safe. \nHowever, upon crossing the base, Casas fell to the ground and immediately grabbed his left knee. He had to be taken from the field on a stretcher. \n\nTriston Casas please be okay omg #RedSox#DirtyWaterpic.twitter.com/JcZhyAPxRe\n— Lucasparmenter23 (@Lucasparmenter0) May 2, 2025\n\n\"It’s a significant knee injury,” Cora said after the game, adding that more information would be available on Saturday. “It seems like he was in shock, to be honest with you.

Won the two big prep races in California, including winning the Santa Anita Derby on April 5. The No. 8 starting position isn’t bad, not the best or worst. The Derby comes down to luck and a good rider. He&#39;s going to need a little bit of luck because he’s going to break relatively quick, but he’s going to be sitting behind the first flight. His jockey [Umberto Rispoli] is an underrated jockey, a rising star in California — this is probably his best shot to win the Derby. Trainer Mike McCarthy used to work for D. Wayne Lukas. This is a Bob Baffert kind of road here, winning the prep races in California. There is a lot to like about Journalism. It’s likely that his odds go up because there are 20 horses, and Baffert is back in the Derby. I suspect Journalism will end up at 4-1 or 5-1. He’s the favorite, but won’t be a huge favorite.&quot;</p><p><strong>No. 18 Sovereignty (5-1): </strong>&quot;He’s outside, which is a good thing, probably running the middle pack early on, maybe 7th to 10th. He’s a horse that has a better record than Sandman (two wins and two second places in five starts). His worst effort was his debut, when he was fourth, so he’s been pretty consistent. Gets a good rider in Junior Alvarado and trainer Bill Mott, who is one of the best trainers to technically never win it outright, but this is one of his best chances to do just that. It used to be you needed three races in your sophomore year to win, but now horses are treated more gingerly. Sovereignty also won a race at Churchill Downs last October. He’s 5-1 in the morning line, I suspect that will go up. Sometimes the public will ignore these horses, so I think he’ll be 7-1, 8-1 or more.&quot;</p><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/70778c30-25d5-11f0-94dd-e695ebc31c8a\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/70778c30-25d5-11f0-94dd-e695ebc31c8a\" style=\"height:2561px;width:3841px;\" alt=\"Trainer Bob Baffert returns to the Kentucky Derby this year.

He’s going to be sitting 12th, 13th, 14th, somewhere in there, and there should be a lot of speed up front that will help a horse like this. If he’s able to weave his way through traffic, he will certainly be a menace in the final quarter mile. He does have a great ride in Jose Ortiz, and his trainer, Mark Casse, is a good trainer in the United States and one of the best in Canada.

There is a home-track advantage since he trains at Churchill Downs, and there’s a lot of speed in the Derby. He’s probably going to 12th or so, early, but he’s coming back to Kentucky where he’s based.

He has no choice, since he’s on the rail. He’ll go to the front and has run well, outside of his last race. He’s won four of six, so his record on paper is pretty good and you’re getting Baffert at 20-1. Stranger things have happened with Baffert. War Emblem got the lead in the Derby and never looked back.

              "content:encodedSnippet": "The 151st Kentucky Derby is nearly here. On Saturday, 20 horses will take the track at Churchill Downs looking to win horse racing's most prestigious event. \nJournalism enters the event as the favorite, but that hasn't been a major indicator of success at the event in recent years. Can Journalism live up to the hype, or will another horse in the field etch a name for itself at the event?\nWith that in mind, here's everything you need to know about the 2025 Kentucky Derby ahead of the race.\nWhen is the 2025 Kentucky Derby?\nThe 2025 Kentucky Derby will be held Saturday, May 3. The race has traditionally taken place the first Saturday in May, though it didn't start that way. From 1875-1931, the race usually occurred in the middle of the month. That changed in 1932, when the event started being held the first Saturday in May.\nThat schedule has remained consistent since 1932, though did change as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The Derby was scheduled for the first Saturday in May originally, but had to be moved to Sept. 5 due to the pandemic. \nKentucky Derby 2025 start time\nCoverage of the 2025 Kentucky Derby will begin much earlier in the day, but the post time for the race is 6:57 p.m. ET. That time is not exact and will move based on how quickly and easily the horses get set up in their posts. \nWhere is the Kentucky Derby in 2025?\nThe Kentucky Derby is always held at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. The race has been held at the track since its inception. Churchill Downs is named after John and Henry Churchill, who leased the land for the racetrack. \nThe track is currently operated by Churchill Downs Incorporated.\n\nKentucky Derby 2025 field, post positions and odds\nBelow is the field, post positions and odds for each horse in the 2025 Kentucky Derby. Citizen Bull holds post position No. 1. Baeza is in post No. 19.\n\nCitizen Bull (20-1)\n\nNeoequos (30-1)\n\nFinal Gambit (30-1)\n\nAmerican Promise (30-1)\n\nAdmire Daytona (30-1)\n\nLuxor Cafe (15-1)\n\nJournalism (3-1)\n\nBurnham Square (12-1)\n\nFlying Mohawk (30-1)\n\nEast Avenue (20-1)\n\nPublisher (20-1)\n\nTiztastic (20-1)\n\nRender Judgment (30-1)\n\nCoal Battle (30-1)\n\nSandman (6-1)\n\nSovereignty (5-1)\n\nChunk of Gold (30-1)\n\nOwen Almighty (30-1)\n\nBaeza (12-1)\n\n*Grande — who was originally slated to start in the ninth post — was scratched Friday due to a foot bruise. His replacement has yet to be named. \nJournalism enters the event as the favorite at 3-1. The morning-line favorite hasn't won the event since 2018, however. The last morning-line favorite to win the Kentucky Derby was Justify.\nPost position matters quite a bit at the Kentucky Derby. Horses in the earlier post positions have traditionally performed better than horses in the later post positions at the event. The fifth post position has resulted in the most wins at the Kentucky Derby, with 10 horses winning from that slot during the race's history. \nNo horse has ever won the race from the No. 17 post, though horses have won the Kentucky Derby from the 18th, 19th and 20th posts in the past. \nKentucky Derby 2025 weather updates\nLouisville is expected to be hit with storms throughout the week. On the actual day of the Kentucky Derby, it's supposed to be partly cloudy with a high of 67 degrees in Louisville. While rain isn't likely on the day of the race, the track will be hit with a lot of precipitation early in the week, which could affect the outcome of the 2025 Kentucky Derby.\nKentucky Derby 2025 payout, purse\nThe winner of the 2025 Kentucky Derby will receive roughly $3.1 million. That's what 2024 winner Mystik Dan won last year.\nIn total, the event has a purse of $5 million. The horse that finishes in second place will win roughly $1 million.\nThe total purse at the event used to be about $3 million, but that changed in 2024, when it shot up to $5 million total.\nBob Baffert is back for the 2025 Kentucky Derby. (Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images)\nAndy Lyons via Getty Images\n\nDoes Bob Baffert have a horse in the 2025 Kentucky Derby?\nControversial trainer Bob Baffert is allowed to return for the 2025 Kentucky Derby after serving a three-year ban from the race. Baffert was banned from the event after 2021 winner Medina Spirit tested positive for a banned steroid.\nMedina Spirit was stripped of its win following a second positive test, leading to Baffert's suspension. Mandaloun was named the winner of the 2021 Kentucky Derby.\nBaffert — who has a lengthy history of his horses failing drug tests — originally had two horses in the 2025 Kentucky Derby: Citizen Bull and Rodriguez. However, Rodriguez was announced as a scratch on Thursday afternoon due to a foot bruise. Rodriguez will be replaced by Baeza, trained by John Shirreffs,  now set to race out of the 20th pole position. Baeza is the half-brother to 2023 Kentucky Derby winner Mage.\nDoes Toby Keith have a horse in the 2025 Kentucky Derby?\nLate country music star Toby Keith owned racehorses for two decades prior to his 2024 death from stomach cancer. He owned a \"thoroughbred breeding and racing operation\" called Dream Walkin Farms, according to WLKY News.\nRender Judgment — which sits in the No. 15 post — is owned by Keith's operation. In the leadup to the 2025 Kentucky Derby, Keith's estate tweeted about Render Judgment's inclusion in the field, saying it \"was Toby's dream\" to have one of his horses run in the Kentucky Derby.\nHow to watch the 2025 Kentucky Derby\nWhile the race won't begin until 6:57 p.m. ET, coverage of the Kentucky Derby will begin at 2:30 p.m. ET on NBC. Peacock will also stream early coverage, which starts at noon ET.\n\nThis year will mark the 25th time the Kentucky Derby has aired on NBC.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.

However, Binnington's glove was partially in the net when he made the catch, making it difficult to tell whether or not the puck had crossed the goal line.\nThe NHL Situation Room ruled that there was no conclusive evidence to overturn what was originally called a no-goal.\n\nJordan Binnington robs Perfetti with the glove... but did the puck cross the line? 👀\n(via @espn) pic.twitter.com/DIygtBThoX\n— BarDown (@BarDown) April 25, 2025\nJets winger David Gustafsson scored later in the third, leaving fans to wonder how the game might have shifted if Perfetti's goal had counted, as Gustafsson's goal would have made it 3-2 with momentum instead of 3-1 in what ultimately ended as a 7-2 loss for the Jets.\nAnother issue is the amount of time it can take for reviews to be conducted. \nIn the Jets game, it took over five minutes to make the decision on the Perfetti no-goal.\nSwings of momentum are important in hockey. One moment, you're buzzing on the power play. The next, your legs get stiff while you wait for the referees to decide the future of the game based on plays that come down to less than inches.\nIn January 2024, Edmonton Oilers superstar Connor McDavid voiced his frustration after an offside review that took nearly 15 minutes to determine whether a Zach Hyman goal was offside or not. \nThe play was eventually overturned, and although the Oilers came away with a 2-1 win, it highlighted a problem with the length of reviews and the difficulty of ensuring they're correct.\nIn April 2025, the NFL announced it would adopt Sony's Hawk-Eye virtual measurement technology, using 8K cameras positioned around the stadium to determine whether the football has crossed the line to gain. On-field officials, who traditionally make these calls while running up and down the field, will be used as backup.\nWhile the NHL has implemented new technology over the years – such as NHL Edge, which provides new advanced statistics on things such as skating speed, skating distance, shot speed, shot location and zone time based on puck and player tracking – the league's lack of goal-line and offside technology sticks out. It continues to be exposed on bigger stages come playoff time and will likely keep causing problems if the NHL doesn't get with the times like other leagues have.\nGet the\nlatest news and trending stories by following The Hockey News on Google News and by\nsubscribing to The Hockey News newsletter here.

              "content:encodedSnippet": "It’s only natural to see several coaches lose their jobs following the end of the season. With only 16 available playoff spots, the other half of the NHL is feeling disappointed and possibly seeking change. \nOne of the easiest ways to search for change is by parting with a coach and hiring a new one. \nSeven coach vacancies exist after the New York Rangers took advantage of a Cup-winning coach hitting the open market, Mike Sullivan, and hired him to replace Peter Laviolette on Friday. If Sullivan can come into New York and get the best out of Alexis Lafreniere, Artemi Panarin, Adam Fox, J.T. Miller and Vincent Trocheck, there’s no reason they can’t compete for a playoff spot next season.\nThere’s still a strong market of available coaches, ranging from veterans to AHL or NCAA coaches looking for an opportunity. Let’s see which coaches whose names surfaced in speculation would be a good fit for each NHL team with a vacancy.\nPhiladelphia Flyers: Pat Ferschweiler\nFerschweiler recently coached Western Michigan University to a national men’s hockey championship in the NCAA, shocking Boston University in the final.

This is the exact total as in last year’s edition, but their identity and ranking differ. </p><p>In 2024, THN had David Reinbacher as Montreal’s top entry in its ranking, 13th place. Lane Hutson was the second entry, 49th place (in hindsight, that should have been much higher). Owen Beck was 60th, Joshua Roy 83rd, and Filip Mesar 89th. </p><p>Of the lot, only Reinbacher remains. Hutson is now an established NHLer and no longer available, while Beck, Roy, and Mesar have all been overtaken by other prospects. Without further ado, here are the five Canadiens’ prospects who have made the rankings for this year&#39;s edition. </p><h1>Ivan Demidov</h1><p>Coming in hot at number one is Ivan Demidov; he’s a new entry since he hadn’t yet been drafted when the list was compiled in 2024, but judging by how many scouts turned up at the Bell Centre to witness his debut, many wish he were theirs. The young Russian made an immediate impact with the Canadiens when he played the last two regular-season games and the five playoff tilts against the Washington Capitals. </p><p>His puck handling, hockey IQ, and compete level are through the roof. If this season was Hutson’s year in Montreal, the next campaign promises to be Demidov’s. His insertion on the first power play from the third game of the playoffs was a game-changer. Two incredibly creative players on the man-advantage unit immediately rejuvenated the Habs&#39; power play. It became less predictable and a real threat. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">What a setup by Ivan Demidov 😮‍💨 <a href=\"https://t.co/VXOvoz5Sj1\">pic.twitter.com/VXOvoz5Sj1</a></p>— Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sportsnet/status/1916645314586464591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2025</a></blockquote><h1>David Reinbacher</h1><p>In 17th place, we find the only name returning from last year’s edition: David Reinbacher. He only lost four spots, even though he was sidelined for most of the season with a knee injury, a true testament to how highly regarded he is by GMs, scouts, and directors of player personnel. </p><p>The Canadiens did their best to ensure Reinbacher didn’t waste any development opportunities, keeping him around the team until he was ready to return to action with the Laval Rocket. The organization is being very careful with the right-shot defenseman, not letting him skate more than once a day, no morning skate for the youngster, and no extra stress put on that surgically repaired knee—until Friday morning, that is. It looks like he’s turned a corner. </p><p>With David Savard hanging up his skates, the Canadiens will have a vacancy on the right side of defense, but will Reinbacher be ready to step into that role? Not yet. I think he could do with a full season in Laval just so the Habs can evaluate what they have in him. He played professional hockey in Switzerland, but the jump to the NHL is big. </p><h1>Michael Hage</h1><p>Another new entry for this edition, Michael Hage is 42nd on the THN’s list. He has plenty of potential and was impressive in his first season in the NCAA, scoring 34 points in 33 games. He was even named freshman of the year in the Big 10. He was fourth in points-per-game amongst all rookies in the NCAA with 1.03.</p><p>We already know that he’s going back to Michigan for a sophomore season, and he needs it. The 19-year-old is six feet one inch but only 190 pounds. He needs to add some muscle to his frame to be effective in the NHL. </p><p>The Canadiens drafted him 21st overall in the last draft, and the organization will have to be patient with him. Don’t expect him to make the jump to the NHL right away.</p><h1>Logan Mailloux</h1><p>Another new entry, Logan Mailloux, lands at number 58. His first season with the Laval Rocket was great; he scored 47 points in 72 games, but things were a lot harder in his sophomore campaign. In 63 games, he scored 33 points, which works out to 0.52 points per game, down from 0.65 in his rookie season. </p><p>The organization had hoped he could have been ready to make the jump to the NHL this season, but it was apparent at camp that he wasn’t quite there yet. This prompted Kent Hughes to turn to the trade market to replace Jonathan Kovacevic, whom he had thought expendable. Still, he managed to flip Justin Barron for Alex Carrier with the Nashville Predators, and it worked out well for the team. </p><p>Mailloux played seven games with the Canadiens this season, scoring four points, but he did not look like a finished product. He was still vulnerable defensively and could probably use more time in Laval. </p><h1>Jacob Fowler</h1><p>The fifth and final Canadiens on the list is newly signed goaltender Jacob Fowler. Hughes did well in signing him to an ELC, which only starts next season, and added an amateur tryout for the end of this year. </p><p>It has allowed a 20-year-old, 6-foot-4, 214-pound supersize goalie to play his first few professional games. He got three games in the regular season with the Rocket, going 2-1-0 with a 2.32 goals-against average and a .914 save percentage. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Jacob Fowler made his AHL debut last night. Here were his saves. He was outstanding. <a href=\"https://t.co/nkAzTM8vEp\">pic.twitter.com/nkAzTM8vEp</a></p>— Grant McCagg (@grantmccagg) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/grantmccagg/status/1911485578673107241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2025</a></blockquote><p>Samuel Montembeault’s tearing his groin also meant that he was tasked with starting the playoffs with the Rocket since Cayden Primeau was acting as backup to Jakub Dobes. With the Canadiens now eliminated, one would have thought Primeau would have taken the reins back, but Fowler was in the starter’s net on Friday morning, with game two being played in the evening. </p><p>In his sophomore season with Boston College, he was a dominant force winning the Mike Richter award as the top goaltender in the NCAA. He finished his season with a 25-7-2 record, a 1.63 GAA and a .940 SP.</p><p>It remains to be seen if that dominance will translate well at the professional level, but what his showed so far definitively has Canadiens&#39; fans excited.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Canadiens stories, analysis, breaking news, and more!

Hughes did well in signing him to an ELC, which only starts next season, and added an amateur tryout for the end of this year. \nIt has allowed a 20-year-old, 6-foot-4, 214-pound supersize goalie to play his first few professional games. He got three games in the regular season with the Rocket, going 2-1-0 with a 2.32 goals-against average and a .914 save percentage. \n\nJacob Fowler made his AHL debut last night. Here were his saves. He was outstanding. pic.twitter.com/nkAzTM8vEp\n— Grant McCagg (@grantmccagg) April 13, 2025\nSamuel Montembeault’s tearing his groin also meant that he was tasked with starting the playoffs with the Rocket since Cayden Primeau was acting as backup to Jakub Dobes. With the Canadiens now eliminated, one would have thought Primeau would have taken the reins back, but Fowler was in the starter’s net on Friday morning, with game two being played in the evening. \nIn his sophomore season with Boston College, he was a dominant force winning the Mike Richter award as the top goaltender in the NCAA. He finished his season with a 25-7-2 record, a 1.63 GAA and a .940 SP.\nIt remains to be seen if that dominance will translate well at the professional level, but what his showed so far definitively has Canadiens' fans excited. \n\nCanadiens stories, analysis, breaking news, and more!

The budget accelerates human space exploration of the Moon and Mars with a fiscally responsible portfolio of missions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This proposal includes investments to simultaneously pursue exploration of the Moon and Mars while still prioritizing critical science and technology research,” said acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro. “I appreciate the President’s continued support for NASA’s mission and look forward to working closely with the administration and Congress to ensure we continue making progress toward achieving the impossible.”</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Increased commitment to human space exploration in pursuit of exploration of both the Moon and Mars. </strong>By allocating more than $7 billion for lunar exploration and introducing $1 billion in new investments for Mars-focused programs, the budget ensures America’s human space exploration efforts remain unparalleled, innovative, and efficient.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Refocus science and space technology resources to efficiently execute high priority research.</strong> Consistent with the administration’s priority of returning to the Moon before China and putting an American on Mars, the budget will advance priority science and research missions and projects, ending financially unsustainable programs including Mars Sample Return. It emphasizes investments in transformative space technologies while responsibly shifting projects better suited for private sector leadership.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Transition the Artemis campaign to a more sustainable, cost-effective approach to lunar exploration.</strong> The SLS (Space Launch System) rocket and Orion capsule will be retired after Artemis III, paving the way for more cost-effective, next-generation commercial systems that will support subsequent NASA lunar missions. The budget also ends the Gateway Program, with the opportunity to repurpose already produced components for use in other missions. International partners will be invited to join these renewed efforts, expanding opportunities for meaningful collaboration on the Moon and Mars.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Continue the process of transitioning the International Space Station to commercial replacements in 2030, focusing onboard research on efforts critical to the exploration of the Moon and Mars.</strong> The budget reflects the upcoming transition to a more cost-effective, open commercial approach to human activities in low Earth orbit by reducing the space station’s crew size and onboard research, preparing for the safe decommissioning of the station and its replacement by commercial space stations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Work to minimize duplication of efforts and most efficiently steward the allocation of American taxpayer dollars. </strong>This budget ensures NASA’s topline enables a financially sustainable trajectory to complete groundbreaking research and execute the agency’s bold mission.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus NASA’s resources on its core mission of space exploration.</strong> This budget ends climate-focused “green aviation” spending while protecting the development of technologies with air traffic control and other U.S. government and commercial applications, producing savings. This budget also will ensure continued elimination any funding toward misaligned DEIA initiatives, instead designating that money to missions capable of advancing NASA’s core mission. NASA will continue to inspire the next generation of explorers through exciting, ambitious space missions that demonstrate American leadership in space.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>NASA will coordinate closely with its partners to execute these priorities and investments as efficiently and effectively as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building on the President’s promise to increase efficiency this budget pioneers a focused, innovative, and fiscally-responsible path to America’s next great era of human space exploration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about the President’s budget request for

              "content:encodedSnippet": "Credit: NASA\n\n\nThe Trump-Vance Administration released toplines of the President’s budget for Fiscal Year 2026 on Friday. The budget accelerates human space exploration of the Moon and Mars with a fiscally responsible portfolio of missions.\n“This proposal includes investments to simultaneously pursue exploration of the Moon and Mars while still prioritizing critical science and technology research,” said acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro. “I appreciate the President’s continued support for NASA’s mission and look forward to working closely with the administration and Congress to ensure we continue making progress toward achieving the impossible.”\nIncreased commitment to human space exploration in pursuit of exploration of both the Moon and Mars. By allocating more than $7 billion for lunar exploration and introducing $1 billion in new investments for Mars-focused programs, the budget ensures America’s human space exploration efforts remain unparalleled, innovative, and efficient.\nRefocus science and space technology resources to efficiently execute high priority research. Consistent with the administration’s priority of returning to the Moon before China and putting an American on Mars, the budget will advance priority science and research missions and projects, ending financially unsustainable programs including Mars Sample Return. It emphasizes investments in transformative space technologies while responsibly shifting projects better suited for private sector leadership.\nTransition the Artemis campaign to a more sustainable, cost-effective approach to lunar exploration. The SLS (Space Launch System) rocket and Orion capsule will be retired after Artemis III, paving the way for more cost-effective, next-generation commercial systems that will support subsequent NASA lunar missions. The budget also ends the Gateway Program, with the opportunity to repurpose already produced components for use in other missions. International partners will be invited to join these renewed efforts, expanding opportunities for meaningful collaboration on the Moon and Mars.\nContinue the process of transitioning the International Space Station to commercial replacements in 2030, focusing onboard research on efforts critical to the exploration of the Moon and Mars. The budget reflects the upcoming transition to a more cost-effective, open commercial approach to human activities in low Earth orbit by reducing the space station’s crew size and onboard research, preparing for the safe decommissioning of the station and its replacement by commercial space stations.\nWork to minimize duplication of efforts and most efficiently steward the allocation of American taxpayer dollars. This budget ensures NASA’s topline enables a financially sustainable trajectory to complete groundbreaking research and execute the agency’s bold mission.\nFocus NASA’s resources on its core mission of space exploration. This budget ends climate-focused “green aviation” spending while protecting the development of technologies with air traffic control and other U.S. government and commercial applications, producing savings. This budget also will ensure continued elimination any funding toward misaligned DEIA initiatives, instead designating that money to missions capable of advancing NASA’s core mission. NASA will continue to inspire the next generation of explorers through exciting, ambitious space missions that demonstrate American leadership in space.\nNASA will coordinate closely with its partners to execute these priorities and investments as efficiently and effectively as possible.\nBuilding on the President’s promise to increase efficiency this budget pioneers a focused, innovative, and fiscally-responsible path to America’s next great era of human space exploration.\nLearn more about the President’s budget request for NASA:\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/budget\n-end-\nBethany Stevens\nHeadquarters, Washington\n771-216-2606\nbethany.c.stevens@nasa.gov\nShare\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDetails\nLast Updated\nMay 02, 2025\n\nEditor\n\nJennifer M.

He has been tasked with solving challenging problems, both individually and as a part of teams.\nThere were times when he was not sure if he or the team would be able to solve the problem or address it effectively, but each time, the NASA Stennis team found a way.\n“Over the span of my career, I have yet to be in a situation where the challenge was not met,” he said.\nThe opportunity to work with “pretty much all the major space companies in some capacity” is most interesting to Williams. “The best thing is that being a small organization within a relatively small center, there are always opportunities to develop new skills and capabilities to help fill a need or gap,” he said.\nNo matter the task, Williams looks forward to supporting space innovation while living up to, and maintaining, the standard of excellence associated with NASA for the benefit of all. \n\t\t\nExplore More\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n3 min read\nLagniappe for April 2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArticle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 month ago\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n4 min read\nLagniappe for March 2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArticle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2 months ago\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n6 min read\nNASA Stennis Flashback: Learning About Rocket Engine Exhaust for Safe Space Travel\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArticle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2 months ago",

Dalcanton, R. J. Foley (UC Santa Cruz), C. Kilpatrick</div>\n</figcaption></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A beautiful but skewed spiral galaxy dazzles in this NASA/ESA <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/\" rel=\"noopener\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> image. The galaxy, called Arp 184 or NGC 1961, sits about 190 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Camelopardalis (The Giraffe).</p>\n<p>The name Arp 184 comes from the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies compiled by astronomer Halton Arp in 1966. It holds 338 galaxies that are oddly shaped and tend to be neither entirely elliptical nor entirely spiral-shaped. Many of the galaxies are in the process of interacting with other galaxies, while others are dwarf galaxies without well-defined structures. Arp 184 earned its spot in the catalog thanks to its single broad, star-speckled spiral arm that appears to stretch toward us. The galaxy’s far side sports a few wisps of gas and stars, but it lacks a similarly impressive spiral arm.</p>\n<p>This Hubble image combines data from three Snapshot observing programs, which are short observations that slotted into time gaps between other proposals. One of the three programs targeted Arp 184 for its peculiar appearance. This program surveyed galaxies listed in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as well as A Catalogue of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations, a similar catalog compiled by Halton Arp and Barry Madore.</p>\n<p>The remaining two Snapshot programs looked at the aftermath of fleeting astronomical events like supernovae and tidal disruption events — like when a supermassive black hole rips a star apart after it wanders too closely. Since Arp 184 hosted four known supernovae in the past three decades, it is a rich target for a supernova hunt.</p>\n<div id=\"\" class=\"hds-social-media hds-social-media--horizontal grid-container

Dalcanton, R. J. Foley (UC Santa Cruz), C. Kilpatrick\n\n\n\nA beautiful but skewed spiral galaxy dazzles in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image. The galaxy, called Arp 184 or NGC 1961, sits about 190 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Camelopardalis (The Giraffe).\nThe name Arp 184 comes from the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies compiled by astronomer Halton Arp in 1966. It holds 338 galaxies that are oddly shaped and tend to be neither entirely elliptical nor entirely spiral-shaped. Many of the galaxies are in the process of interacting with other galaxies, while others are dwarf galaxies without well-defined structures. Arp 184 earned its spot in the catalog thanks to its single broad, star-speckled spiral arm that appears to stretch toward us. The galaxy’s far side sports a few wisps of gas and stars, but it lacks a similarly impressive spiral arm.\nThis Hubble image combines data from three Snapshot observing programs, which are short observations that slotted into time gaps between other proposals. One of the three programs targeted Arp 184 for its peculiar appearance. This program surveyed galaxies listed in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as well as A Catalogue of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations, a similar catalog compiled by Halton Arp and Barry Madore.\nThe remaining two Snapshot programs looked at the aftermath of fleeting astronomical events like supernovae and tidal disruption events — like when a supermassive black hole rips a star apart after it wanders too closely. Since Arp 184 hosted four known supernovae in the past three decades, it is a rich target for a supernova hunt.\nFacebook logo\n\t\t\t\n@NASAHubble\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n@NASAHubble\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInstagram logo \n  \n\t\t\t\n@NASAHubble\t\t\t\n\n\nMedia Contact:\nClaire Andreoli (claire.andreoli@nasa.gov)\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\nLast Updated\n\nMay 02, 2025\n\n\n\nEditor\nAndrea Gianopoulos\nLocation\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\n\nRelated Terms\nHubble Space Telescope\nAstrophysics\nAstrophysics Division\nGalaxies\nGoddard Space Flight Center\nSpiral Galaxies\nThe Universe\n\n\nKeep Exploring\nDiscover More Topics From Hubble\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHubble Space Telescope\n\n\nSince its 1990 launch, the Hubble Space Telescope has changed our fundamental understanding of the universe.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHubble’s Galaxies\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTracing the Growth of Galaxies\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReshaping Our Cosmic View: Hubble Science Highlights",

Now it’s mapping the entire sky — not just a large part of it — to chart the positions of hundreds of millions of galaxies in 3D to answer some big questions about the universe. On May 1, the spacecraft began regular science operations, which consist of taking about 3,600 images per day for the next two years to provide new insights about the origins of the universe, galaxies, and the ingredients for life in the Milky Way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"SPHEREx Scans the Sky\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EuO-u9airpA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">This video shows SPHEREx’s field of view as it scans across one section of sky inside the Large Magellanic Cloud, with rainbow colors representing the infrared wavelengths the telescope’s detectors see. The view from one detector array moves from purple to green, followed by the second array’s view, which changes from yellow to red. The images are looped four times. NASA/JPL-Caltech</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thanks to the hard work of teams across NASA, industry, and academia that built this mission, SPHEREx is operating just as we’d expected and will produce maps of the full sky unlike any we’ve had before,” said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director of the Astrophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “This new observatory is adding to the suite of space-based astrophysics survey missions leading up to the launch of NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Together with these other missions, SPHEREx will play a key role in answering the big questions about the universe we tackle at NASA every day.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From its perch in Earth orbit, <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/spherex/\" rel=\"noopener\">SPHEREx</a> peers into the darkness, pointing away from the planet and the Sun. The observatory will complete more than 11,000 orbits over its 25 months of planned survey operations, circling Earth about 14½ times a day. It orbits Earth from north to south, passing over the poles, and each day it takes images along one circular strip of the sky. As the days pass and the planet moves around the Sun, SPHEREx’s field of view shifts as well so that after six months, the observatory will have looked out into space in every direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When SPHEREx takes a picture of the sky, the light is sent to six detectors that each produces a unique image capturing different wavelengths of light. These groups of six images are called an exposure, and SPHEREx takes about 600 exposures per day. When it’s done with one exposure, the whole observatory shifts position — the mirrors and detectors don’t move as they do on some other telescopes. Rather than using thrusters, SPHEREx relies on a system of reaction wheels, which spin inside the spacecraft to control its orientation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of SPHEREx’s images will be digitally woven together to create four all-sky maps in two years. By mapping the entire sky, the mission will <a href=\"https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/what-hundreds-of-millions-of-galaxies-can-teach-us-about-the-big-bang\" rel=\"noopener\">provide new insights</a> about what happened in the first fraction of a second after the big bang. In that brief instant, an event called cosmic inflation caused the universe to expand a trillion-trillionfold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re going to study what happened on the smallest size scales in the universe’s earliest moments by looking at the modern universe on the largest scales,” said Jim Fanson, the mission’s project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “I think there’s a poetic arc to that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cosmic inflation subtly influenced the distribution of matter in the universe, and clues about how such an event could happen are written into the positions of galaxies across the universe. When cosmic inflation began, the universe was smaller than the size of an atom, but the properties of that early universe were stretched out and influence what we see today. No other known event or process involves the amount of energy that would have been required to drive cosmic inflation, so studying it presents a unique opportunity to understand more deeply how our universe works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Some of us have been working toward this goal for 12 years,” said Jamie Bock, the mission’s principal investigator at Caltech and JPL. “The performance of the instrument is as good as we hoped. That means we’re going to be able to do all the amazing science we planned on and perhaps even get some unexpected discoveries.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Color Field</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The SPHEREx observatory won’t be the first to map the entire sky, but it will be the first to do so in so many colors. It <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/spherex/why-nasas-spherex-mission-will-make-most-colorful-cosmic-map-ever/\">observes 102 wavelengths</a>, or colors, of infrared light, which are undetectable to the human eye. Through a technique called spectroscopy, the telescope separates the light into wavelengths — much like a prism creates a rainbow from sunlight — revealing all kinds of information about cosmic sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, spectroscopy can be harnessed to determine the distance to a faraway galaxy, information that can be used to turn a 2D map of those galaxies into a 3D one. The technique will also enable the mission to measure the collective glow from all the galaxies that ever existed and see how that glow has changed over cosmic time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And spectroscopy can reveal the composition of objects. <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/universe/nasas-spherex-space-telescope-will-seek-lifes-ingredients/\">Using this capability</a>, the mission is searching for water and other key ingredients for life in these systems in our galaxy. It’s thought that the water in Earth’s oceans originated as frozen water molecules attached to dust in the interstellar cloud where the Sun formed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SPHEREx mission will make over 9 million observations of interstellar clouds in the Milky Way, mapping these materials across the galaxy and helping scientists understand how different conditions can affect the chemistry that produced many of the compounds found on Earth today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>More About SPHEREx</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The SPHEREx mission is managed by JPL for the agency’s Astrophysics Division within the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. BAE Systems in Boulder, Colorado, built the telescope and the spacecraft bus. The science analysis of the SPHEREx data will be conducted by a team of scientists located at 10 institutions in the U.S., two in South Korea, and one in Taiwan. Caltech in Pasadena managed and integrated the instrument. The mission’s principal investigator is based at Caltech with a joint JPL appointment. Data will be processed and archived at <a href=\"https://urldefense.us/v3/__https:/www.ipac.caltech.edu/project/spherex__;!!PvBDto6Hs4WbVuu7!Oz9sYEmxZK5HFIo5oa1jlNzI7W-u--wkp2gtkTVYrfAkwWby2Zy62PvQpwpDyDziD_bJT3plt8AXDqX0zxivB3DqpN3_$\" rel=\"noopener\">IPAC</a> at Caltech.

This image shows a section of sky in one wavelength (3.29 microns), revealing a cloud of dust made of a molecule similar to soot or smoke.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThis image from NASA’s SPHEREx shows the same region of space in a different infrared wavelength (0.98 microns), but the dust cloud is no longer visible. The molecules that compose the dust — polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons — do not radiate light in this color.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nAfter weeks of preparation, the space observatory has begun its science mission, taking about 3,600 unique images per day to create a map of the cosmos like no other.\nLaunched on March 11, NASA’s SPHEREx space observatory has spent the last six weeks undergoing checkouts, calibrations, and other activities to ensure it is working as it should. Now it’s mapping the entire sky — not just a large part of it — to chart the positions of hundreds of millions of galaxies in 3D to answer some big questions about the universe. On May 1, the spacecraft began regular science operations, which consist of taking about 3,600 images per day for the next two years to provide new insights about the origins of the universe, galaxies, and the ingredients for life in the Milky Way.\n\n\nThis video shows SPHEREx’s field of view as it scans across one section of sky inside the Large Magellanic Cloud, with rainbow colors representing the infrared wavelengths the telescope’s detectors see. The view from one detector array moves from purple to green, followed by the second array’s view, which changes from yellow to red. The images are looped four times. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n\n\n“Thanks to the hard work of teams across NASA, industry, and academia that built this mission, SPHEREx is operating just as we’d expected and will produce maps of the full sky unlike any we’ve had before,” said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director of the Astrophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “This new observatory is adding to the suite of space-based astrophysics survey missions leading up to the launch of NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Together with these other missions, SPHEREx will play a key role in answering the big questions about the universe we tackle at NASA every day.”\nFrom its perch in Earth orbit, SPHEREx peers into the darkness, pointing away from the planet and the Sun. The observatory will complete more than 11,000 orbits over its 25 months of planned survey operations, circling Earth about 14½ times a day. It orbits Earth from north to south, passing over the poles, and each day it takes images along one circular strip of the sky. As the days pass and the planet moves around the Sun, SPHEREx’s field of view shifts as well so that after six months, the observatory will have looked out into space in every direction.\nWhen SPHEREx takes a picture of the sky, the light is sent to six detectors that each produces a unique image capturing different wavelengths of light. These groups of six images are called an exposure, and SPHEREx takes about 600 exposures per day. When it’s done with one exposure, the whole observatory shifts position — the mirrors and detectors don’t move as they do on some other telescopes. Rather than using thrusters, SPHEREx relies on a system of reaction wheels, which spin inside the spacecraft to control its orientation.\nHundreds of thousands of SPHEREx’s images will be digitally woven together to create four all-sky maps in two years. By mapping the entire sky, the mission will provide new insights about what happened in the first fraction of a second after the big bang. In that brief instant, an event called cosmic inflation caused the universe to expand a trillion-trillionfold.\n“We’re going to study what happened on the smallest size scales in the universe’s earliest moments by looking at the modern universe on the largest scales,” said Jim Fanson, the mission’s project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “I think there’s a poetic arc to that.”\nCosmic inflation subtly influenced the distribution of matter in the universe, and clues about how such an event could happen are written into the positions of galaxies across the universe. When cosmic inflation began, the universe was smaller than the size of an atom, but the properties of that early universe were stretched out and influence what we see today. No other known event or process involves the amount of energy that would have been required to drive cosmic inflation, so studying it presents a unique opportunity to understand more deeply how our universe works.\n“Some of us have been working toward this goal for 12 years,” said Jamie Bock, the mission’s principal investigator at Caltech and JPL. “The performance of the instrument is as good as we hoped. That means we’re going to be able to do all the amazing science we planned on and perhaps even get some unexpected discoveries.”\nColor Field\nThe SPHEREx observatory won’t be the first to map the entire sky, but it will be the first to do so in so many colors. It observes 102 wavelengths, or colors, of infrared light, which are undetectable to the human eye. Through a technique called spectroscopy, the telescope separates the light into wavelengths — much like a prism creates a rainbow from sunlight — revealing all kinds of information about cosmic sources.\nFor example, spectroscopy can be harnessed to determine the distance to a faraway galaxy, information that can be used to turn a 2D map of those galaxies into a 3D one. The technique will also enable the mission to measure the collective glow from all the galaxies that ever existed and see how that glow has changed over cosmic time.\nAnd spectroscopy can reveal the composition of objects. Using this capability, the mission is searching for water and other key ingredients for life in these systems in our galaxy. It’s thought that the water in Earth’s oceans originated as frozen water molecules attached to dust in the interstellar cloud where the Sun formed.\nThe SPHEREx mission will make over 9 million observations of interstellar clouds in the Milky Way, mapping these materials across the galaxy and helping scientists understand how different conditions can affect the chemistry that produced many of the compounds found on Earth today.\nMore About SPHEREx\nThe SPHEREx mission is managed by JPL for the agency’s Astrophysics Division within the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. BAE Systems in Boulder, Colorado, built the telescope and the spacecraft bus. The science analysis of the SPHEREx data will be conducted by a team of scientists located at 10 institutions in the U.S., two in South Korea, and one in Taiwan. Caltech in Pasadena managed and integrated the instrument. The mission’s principal investigator is based at Caltech with a joint JPL appointment. Data will be processed and archived at IPAC at Caltech. The SPHEREx dataset will be publicly available at the NASA-IPAC Infrared Science Archive. Caltech manages JPL for NASA.\nFor more about SPHEREx, visit:\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/mission/spherex/\nNews Media Contact\nCalla Cofield\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n626-808-2469\ncalla.e.cofield@jpl.nasa.gov\n2025-063\nShare\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDetails\nLast Updated\nMay 01, 2025\n\nRelated Terms\n\nSPHEREx (Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe and Ices Explorer)\nAstrophysics\nExoplanets\nGalaxies\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nThe Search for Life\nThe Universe\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\nExplore More\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2 min read\nHubble Images a Peculiar Spiral\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA beautiful but skewed spiral galaxy dazzles in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image.
